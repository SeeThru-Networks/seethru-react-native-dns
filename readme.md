# SeeThru React Native App

The aim of this react native app is to collect and display Domain Name Server (DNS) information - this should be obtained via a library or custom code, there is no API to parse. 

The app has been setup with a place to display the DNS information in `app.js`. Any collected DNS should be provided in IPv4 format using a comma seperated list.
